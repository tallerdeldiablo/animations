Pendulum
This is an expression you can use to generate a decaying pendulum motion.

The pendulum consists of a rectangular solid and a square solid with a circular mask applied. The anchor point of the rectangular solid has been moved to the upper edge. The square solid is parented to the retangular solid.

Apply the following expression to the rotation property of the rectangular solid:


veloc = 7; 
amplitude = 80; 
decay = .7;
 
amplitude*Math.sin(veloc*time)/Math.exp(decay*time) 
Adjust the velocity, amplitude and decay parameters to suit your needs.
