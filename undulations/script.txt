Undulations
You can use these wave exressions to simulate an undulating surface .

Apply the following expression to the position property of an object:


xAmp = 3; //height of undulations (pixels)
xFreq = .3; //undulations per second
xSpeed = 150; //speed of wave (pixels per second)

wl = xSpeed/xFreq; //wavelength (pixels)
phaseOffset = ((position[0]%wl)/wl)*2*Math.PI;
y = xAmp*Math.sin(2*Math.PI*xFreq*time + phaseOffset);
value + [0,y]
Apply this expression to the rotation porperty:


xFreq = .3; //undulations per second
xSpeed = 150; //speed of wave (pixels per second)
damping = 15; //undulation damping factor

wl = xSpeed/xFreq; //wavelength (pixels)
phaseOffset = ((position[0]%wl)/wl)*2*Math.PI;
theta = Math.atan(Math.cos(2*Math.PI*xFreq*time + phaseOffset));
radiansToDegrees(theta)/damping;
Adjust xAmp, xFreq, xSpeed, and damping to control the speed and depth of the undulations.

Note that the expressions take into account the original position of the objects, so that objects spread out in the x direction will react at different times as the wave passes by.
