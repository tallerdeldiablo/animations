# JS Animations Showcase

## **Description**
This project is inspired by the exceptional work of **Dan Ebberts** and his **AE Expressions Lab**. Dan's groundbreaking contributions to After Effects scripting and expressions have been invaluable to the creative community. While his original site relied on Flash, which is no longer supported, this project serves as a modern reinterpretation and tribute to his legacy.

The **JS Animations Showcase** brings some of his iconic concepts into a browser-based, interactive format. It ensures that the essence of his teachings remains accessible to creators, developers, and enthusiasts for years to come.
